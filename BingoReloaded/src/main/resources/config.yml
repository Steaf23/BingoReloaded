# Choose between:
#   - SINGULAR: The main server world is repurposed for the use of bingo. This mode assumes that bingo is the only gamemode or gameplay option on the server
#       This makes is good to just play a few rounds with some friends without worrying about the world configurations
#       This can also be used for bigger server networks where each server represents an instance of the game.
#   - MULTIPLE: The plugin creates worlds specifically for the purpose of playing bingo.
#       The main world can be converted to a lobby world but this is not required.
configuration: SINGULAR

# This option means different things for each configuration:
#   - SINGULAR: This world is the one where bingo is played. The plugin will not create this world, so make sure to create it before running this plugin.
#     to allow the plugin to use the Nether and End dimensions, the names `<defaultWorldName>_nether` and `<defaultWorldName>_the_end` must also be valid worlds.
#   - MULTIPLE: This world is used more like a lobby world, however it is not required. The actual game worlds can be will be created using autobingo commands .
#     In this case, players can be teleported to any active game world using the /autobingo teleport command

# The yml file that contains the language data that will be used for this plugin

# If true this will prevent the player from receiving the voting item, allowing custom implementations using the available autobingo command.

#    Player Data Configuration Options
# ==========================================================================
# For the purpose of loading and saving player data, any world outside the selected world in defaultWorldName or the worlds created by the plugin itself,
#   is considered a plugin world and player data will not be saved there. When a player travels to a plugin world from the outside, player information can be retained.
#   This data can then be restored when entering any non-plugin world again.

# Enabling this option will save any player's state (inventory, position, spawn point, levels, etc...)
#   when they enter this world by teleportation or otherwise.
# NOTE: If set to false, all current player state will be removed when joining a bingo world (including inventory contents!)
savePlayerInformation: true

# This option only has an effect when savePlayerInformation is true. Determine the moment that the game will load the player's data,
#   possibly sending them back to another world.
# Possible values are:
#   - AFTER_GAME: player data for all game players gets loaded as soon as the game end.
#   - AFTER_LEAVING_WORLD: A player's data gets loaded only when they have left the bingo world
# If this option is set to anything other than AFTER_LEAVING_WORLD and the player leaves the bingo world anyway, their data will also be loaded.
#   (To prevent this from happening at all, disable savePlayerInformation)
